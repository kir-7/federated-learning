# Tasks

* __Kireeti__ : Implement other two algorithms: FedSVRG, CO-OP: changes in file utils.py and a new file algos.py.
* __Fariz__ : Implement other medical datasets related to vision (image classification is simple and good) modify existing functions for iid and non iid distribution of this dataset : changes to be made in sampling and utils.py file to load the new dataset.    
* __Charitha__ : Implement CNN model for this dataset, and make changes to update.py file and models.py file.
* __Kireeti__ : run the new datasets, models, algos and aggregate the results.


For FedSVRG the input is the dataset, the model and a sampler function that is used to partition the given dataset for each client, depending on technique(iit, non iid)
